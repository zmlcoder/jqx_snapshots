Hello,

I am working the jqWidgets with the angular, then I found seems there would be some memory leaking when using the jqxGrid.

I created one simple test case in http://plnkr.co/edit/Khgo7Lx4XbTlRyM977kF

The demo contain two button to navigate 'step1' between 'step2'.

The reproducing steps:
	1. Go into step1, then open the Chrome dev tool and switch to Profiles, take one Snapshot for the js heap(Snapshot1).
	2. Clikc the 'step2222' button to route into step2 page.
	3. Click the 'step1111' button to route back to step1 page, then take one  Snapshot for the js heap(Snapshot2).
	4. Select 'Snapshot2' then compare with 'Snapshot1' via switch the view to 'Comparison'.
	5. Input 'scope' into 'Class filter".
	6. Input 'jqx' into 'Class filter'

Expect result:
	5. Just remain 'ChildScope' of 'Step1Controller' and the 'ChildScope' of 'Step2Controller' should be destroy.
	6. The objects from jqWidget should be removed.

Actual result:
	5. The 'ChildScope' of 'Step2Controller' still remain stay in memory.
	6. The 'i.jqx.dataAdapter' still remain in memory.

My analyze:
	5. Select the 'ChildScope' of 'Step2Controller', in Retainers view, we can find there is one reference 'jqx._jqxGrid.prototype.definedInstance' to the scope. Then I check the code, I found in 'jqxAngular.js', the 'extendInstance' method will extend the jqxGrid prototype with the 'definedInstance' method, which would hold the scope instance in the jqxGrid prototype. And I can not find any remove code in the 'destroy' method. I think maybe it is the cause.

	6. The 'i.jqx.dataAdapter' seems also missing some clean action.


Thanks in advance.
